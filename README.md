# TTK 0.0.0

Download here! https://github.com/BahresAtli/TravelLogger-TTK/releases/download/TTK_0.0.0/TTK_0.0.0.apk

## Important note

This version is for the first ever release and not a complete project. There might be many bugs other than listed, do not entirely trust this app for saving your travel data, at least for now. Though if you want to test, you are more than welcome!

Also unfortunately, you cannot use this data for this version if you do not have root permission on the phone. In the next update, there will be exporting system for all of your data.

## The TTK 0.0.0 is here! 

TTK App aims to save your time and location stream data into your phone for following your travel history. Press "Start" and it will save your location into a local database every 10 seconds, also storing total elapsed time. You can also label your measurements after you press finish. 

## What TTK 0.0.0 can do:

Save the elapsed time for a travel

Save your location every 10 seconds into local database


## Known bugs

You need to always enable the location permission. If you disable the location permission, the app will crash.

App searches for the location data, even after you press "Finish" (even though it does not save the location data after pressing finish)

Setting a label for the measurement can be pretty rough experience. It is not smooth.

You cannot access the database without getting help from external application and root permission on your phone.

## What's next?

Since it is the first release, there is so much missing from the app for it to be truly an useful Travel Logger app. Here is some features I'm planning to add in the future:

Distance data

Speedometer

Better location map

Better labeling

Classifying the type of vehicles (walking, cycling, car, public transport...)

Ability to save your vehicle info such as plate, bus number (for public transit systems) etc.
