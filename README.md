# TTK 0.0.2

## Important note

This version might not be stable. There might be many bugs other than listed, do not entirely trust this app for saving your travel data, at least for now. Though if you want to test, you are more than welcome!

## Updates with TTK 0.0.2

Database export is finally added. You can export your data via pressing the Export Data button at the bottom. It will save your records as a .db file called TTK_(date)_(time).db, which you can find from your Download folder.

Multilanguage infrastructure along with the Turkish language support is added. If your device region is set to Turkey, TTK App will be shown in Turkish. More languages might be supported in the future.

The frequency of saving location info to the local database is reduced from 10 seconds to 1 second. This improvement is for more precise measurement. In future updates, you will be able to change the frequency to your preference.

Utilities for label (copy, paste, clear) is added.

Location permission is now optional. You can only measure the elapsed time without location, if you disable the permission.

Major infrastructural improvements, improved the quality of code.


## The TTK App is here! 

TTK App aims to save your time and location stream data into your phone for following your travel history. Press "Start" and it will save your location into a local database every second, also storing total elapsed time. You can also label your measurements after you press finish. 

## What TTK App can do:

Save the elapsed time for a travel

Save your location every 10 seconds into local database

Save distance and speed info


## Known bugs

Poor GPS condition can get you inaccurate results. App should be fine on places where GPS signal is great.

Because app saves your location every second while measuring, if you're using this app too often database can grow very large (approx. 10mb every 2 weeks), so don't forget to back up your data with export if it gets too large. This massive data may cause unexpected behavior.

## What's next?

Better location map

Better accuracy

Classifying the type of vehicles (walking, cycling, car, public transport...)

Ability to save your vehicle info such as plate, bus number (for public transit systems) etc.

Better UI

Viewing your history in-app
